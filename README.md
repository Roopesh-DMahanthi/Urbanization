# Urbanization

Flutter Code at - Urbanization/urbanization/lib/main.dart

What it does

It can control traffic congestion, air pollution by reducing the number of vehicles on the road, Our plan is to organize the cities in the form of communities - under the control of Communities Head. It will merge the delivery cities into one and reduces the vehicle count driving on the road which in turns reduces the air pollution and congestion problems
How we built it

We used Machine learning algorithms and some previous year's data to train a neuron in order to predict the future outcomes of congestion at a particular time period of the day. which will help people in the navigation to decide routes to go through in the fastest and less congested way.

Logistics is the other most important thing which needs to be controlled in an organized manner to reduce air pollution from these vehicles. Our app will unite all the delivery services and provide delivery service and the money saved in this order will be helped for the plantation and community growth in the city

Using Flutter we created a beautiful application that is user-friendly and scalable and reliable in a technical way. And We used Firebase for database and FirebaseAuth for User Authentication to perform role-based application And we used a Perceptron to train the neuron and get the expected outputs or future predictions regarding congestion.
Challenges we ran into

    Getting the dataset to train the neuron
    Cleaning the data and ran into random and unpredictable answers at the middle and fixed at the end

Accomplishments that we're proud of

    We successfully able to find the optimal routes in the cities using our navigation methods implemented in our app - If this came into effect of production level in a city like Delhi we can reduce the air pollution by 15% from the current scenario.
    We are able to make the cities as a group of communities which make a lot of things easier like - Car Pooling, Food/Logistics Delivery such that the amount of pollution will reduce in a level and saving the resources

What we learned

We learned how we can make scalable and reliable apps using flutter. Teammates actually able to understand how to make native apps using flutter
What's next for Urbanization

We are planning to make our idea in a production level by conducting an experiment in a city... and by analyzing the outputs and learning from mistakes, we are planning to make our idea as a role model of futuristic urban cities
